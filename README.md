# FPGA-implementation-of-binary-to-grey-code-using-vivado-software-
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a Binary to Gray Code converter on an FPGA using Vivado, a popular software tool by Xilinx. Gray Code is a type of binary numbering system where only one bit changes when moving from one number to the next, making it useful for reducing errors in digital systems.

# Project Overview
In digital systems, binary numbers can sometimes lead to errors during transitions, especially when two or more bits change simultaneously. Gray Code helps reduce this issue by ensuring only one bit changes at a time. This project uses Verilog code to design a Binary to Gray Code converter, which is then implemented on an FPGA using Xilinx Vivado.

# Key Features
Binary to Gray Code Conversion: Converts standard binary numbers into Gray Code format.
FPGA Implementation: The design is tested and verified on an FPGA, showcasing practical hardware implementation.
Verilog Code: All code is written in Verilog, a popular hardware description language.
Vivado Simulation: The project includes testbench simulations to verify the functionality before deploying to the FPGA.

# How to Use
Clone this repository and open the project in Xilinx Vivado.
Load the provided Verilog files.
Run the simulation to verify that the binary-to-Gray Code conversion works correctly.
Program your FPGA to implement the converter in hardware.

# Requirements
Xilinx Vivado Software (for simulation and FPGA programming)
FPGA development board ( for hardware testing)

# Applications
This project is useful for applications in error minimization for digital systems, sensors, rotary encoders, and other fields where signal reliability is critical.
